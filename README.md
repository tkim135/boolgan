It involves my design of a Computer Vision / Deep Learning framework,
whereby the computer takes in a dataset of car images and uses artificial 
intelligence to generate new car images. The specific framework I build on 
top of is called the DCGAN. I have made several changes to the structure that improve 
the model's performance that include adding Wasserstein loss, dropout layers, and convolutional layers.
I have named my end result BoolGAN.
